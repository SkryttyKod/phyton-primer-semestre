Watched the final 10 minutes on YouTube and it's just as tedious as the rest of the game is. Very funny, nihilistic ending though which almost made me give the game two stars if it wasn't for literally everything else here. At least it's mostly funny-bad instead of boring-bad. Not by much though (like 60-40) and it's still just an overall torturous experience. They really did double-down on the ring levels here and while it can be somewhat of a thrill when you're going super fast performing a tricky maneuver of hastily placed/moving rings there's just SO many of these levels and they go on FOREVER. Almost lost my mind a few times here. Still those levels are more competent than any of the actual mission objectives and their asinine level designs. Definitely a rushed game to say the least."", 'this is only getting a half a star bump up because i kinda love how broken this game is, its really funny to mess around with friends', 'no es un videojuego']",859,2,76,55

As some Reploids participate in violent and destructive crime, a police organization called the ""Maverick Hunters"" has been established to stamp out this activity. Maverick crime is rising in newly constructed cities. As this new crime wave hits, X retires, tired from the never-ending battles. A new group of vigilantes, Red Alert, is introduced. One of their members, Axl, decides he has had enough of their ""murdering"" and tries to leave the group.

It is the second game in the Gungrave reboot and will cover new story content for the game series.
              
              The game is set to take place after Gungrave VR which is a remake of the PS2 Gungrave game that also covers the story of Gungrave Overdose to some extent.","[""It's hard to address Gungrave G.O.R.E without first talking about the elephant in the room; that being the amount of players, both on the critics and average players' sides of things, that just didn't seem to click with the game. In many respects, I can see where they're coming from. They're likely people with zero frame of reference for what Gungrave is, which can't exactly be helped. The original PS2 games are stranded with seemingly no hope of full HD remasters, and the only shot you had of getting your foot in the door was the VR exclusive title released to whet the appetites of the few fans left."", ""Gungrave Overdose but i'm allowed to have fun"", '[GERMAN]', ""This sucks in a way I find completely fascinating, like it was poorly made because the focus of the project was securing funding for the project.

Whereas Hi-Fi Rush felt like all of the good things about 2000s video games distilled and modernized into a gorgeous and wonderful package, Gungrave G.O.R.E feels like the bad and boring parts. The game almost plays itself with how easy it is and the tedium is compounded with a lack of variety, bad controls, bad melee combat, and general sluggishness in both the movement and combat pacing, with special moves taking too long and resulting in long, non-interactble segments. The story is complete nonesense, hearkening back to budget PlayStation 2 games.
